This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: passing an argument of an incorrect type to a function.  The `greeter` function expects a single string, but the code attempts to pass an array of strings.  The solution shows how to correctly handle this using type assertions or by modifying the function signature.  This example highlights TypeScript's strong typing system and how it helps catch errors at compile time, preventing runtime surprises.
